BeerProgCannon - a game for Pils og Programmering
-------------------------------------------------

The game consists of a cannon at the bottom of the browser window, that rotates with mouse movement and shoots beers
when the mouse button is clicked (the cannon "loads" for a short time - it is not a machine gun).

Plans for the game:

Images of attendends of "pils og programmering" fly around in the sky. You need to provide them with beer as they are
o'rly so busy programming. They are thirsty help them out!

So, this is version 0.0.1

TODO:

Implement images of people flying across the screen
Collision detection
Facebook integration

A done feature pushed by a member of pils and programming will get a free ber from me (pan100)....
